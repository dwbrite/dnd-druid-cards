Druid spell-deck based off of pagan symbols and the official dnd 5e character sheet. The deck is generated with JS/HTML/CSS and data from http://www.dnd5eapi.co/

Check out the [pdf](https://github.com/dwbrite/dnd-druid-cards/blob/main/druid_deck.pdf) to see the results without needing to overload their servers :^)

I use this deck to keep track of what spells my Druid has prepared by keeping a "hand" of available spells.
